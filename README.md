# How I Did The Restaurent Review Dataset Analysis
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
   * Used PorterStemmer library to find the root word and Stemming the words and removing the stopwords.
   * Creating a corpus to store collection of words.
   * Create Bag of words model A bag-of-words model, or BoW for short, is a way of extracting features from text for use in modeling.

3. Training Model
   * Train and fitted model based on MultinomialNB Na√Øve Bayes algorithm .
   * Calculated the Accuracy, Precision and Recall Scores of the Model.
   * Made the confusion matrix and plotted it.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning 
   * Hypertuned the alpha parameter which by default is 1.0 and is known for Additive (Laplace/Lidstone) smoothing parameter (0 for no smoothing).
